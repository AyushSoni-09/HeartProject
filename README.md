Heart Disease Risk Prediction using Machine Learning (Python)
This project aims to develop a machine learning model using Python to predict the risk of heart disease. Early detection of heart disease is crucial for improving patient outcomes and reducing mortality rates. This project leverages the power of machine learning to create a tool that can potentially contribute to improved public health.

Project Structure:
data: This folder will contain the heart disease dataset used for training and testing the model.
notebooks: Jupyter notebooks containing code for data preprocessing, model development, evaluation, and (optional) deployment.
requirements.txt: This file will list the Python libraries required for the project.
README.md (This file)


Getting Started:
Install dependencies: Run pip install -r requirements.txt to install the necessary Python libraries.
Download data: Obtain a heart disease dataset from a public repository like UCI Machine Learning Repository or Kaggle. Place the dataset in the data folder.
Run notebooks: Open the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks folder and execute the code cells sequentially.


Notebooks:
data_preprocessing.ipynb: This notebook cleans, preprocesses, and explores the heart disease data.
model_development.ipynb: This notebook implements and evaluates various machine learning algorithms for predicting heart disease risk.
model_evaluation.ipynb (Optional): This notebook (if included) performs further analysis and evaluation of the chosen model's performance.
deployment.ipynb (Optional): This notebook (if included) demonstrates how to deploy the model as a web application using frameworks like Flask or Streamlit.


Expected Outcomes:
A robust and accurate Python-based model for predicting the risk of heart disease.
Improved early detection and prevention of cardiovascular diseases through personalized risk assessment.
Enhanced decision-making for healthcare professionals in managing patients with heart disease risk factors.
Increased public awareness and knowledge about heart disease prevention strategies.
